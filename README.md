Hi!

Please, on your honor, do not refer to this code until you have solved the problems yourselves.  You only do yourself a disservice
by not solving these problems yourselves.

That said, if you have any comments about the quality of the code, or if you have any suggestions for improvements, please let me
know.  I welcome any Issues or Pull requests.

With warmest regards, your servant,
